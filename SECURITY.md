# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The MushinAI team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them via email to: **security@mushinai.com**

You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

## Supported Versions

We release patches for security vulnerabilities for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Update Process

1. The reported security issue is received and assigned to a primary handler
2. The problem is confirmed and a list of affected versions is determined
3. Code is audited to find any similar problems
4. Fixes are prepared for all supported versions
5. Security advisory is created and published

## Security Hardening

### Development Practices

- All code must pass security linting before merge
- Dependencies are regularly updated and scanned for vulnerabilities
- Regular security audits are performed
- Sensitive data is never logged or exposed in error messages

### Infrastructure Security

- All data is encrypted in transit and at rest
- Access controls follow the principle of least privilege
- Regular security patches are applied to all systems
- Intrusion detection and monitoring are in place

### API Security

- All API endpoints require authentication
- Rate limiting is enforced to prevent abuse
- Input validation is performed on all user data
- CORS policies are strictly configured

## Best Practices for Users

### Authentication

- Use strong, unique passwords
- Enable multi-factor authentication when available
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials
- Never share authentication credentials

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data before storage
- Use secure communication channels
- Regularly backup critical data
- Follow data retention policies

### System Configuration

- Keep all software up to date
- Use firewalls and network segmentation
- Monitor system logs for suspicious activity
- Implement proper access controls

## Compliance

MushinAI Enterprise Platform is designed with compliance in mind:

- GDPR compliant data handling
- SOC 2 Type II certification (in progress)
- HIPAA compliant configurations available
- Regular third-party security assessments
